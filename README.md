# integrated-parking-system
AI-powered smart parking solution that utilizes computer
vision and deep learning for real-time parking detection and surveillance. It integrates IP cameras to capture live footage, processes the input using advanced machine learning
models, and accurately detects available parking spaces. The detected parking availability
is then displayed through a real-time user interface, allowing users to check and book spots
efficiently.By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the system ensures high accuracy in
vehicle detection and space identification, even under varying environmental conditions.
Additionally, it enhances security through surveillance and anomaly detection, reducing
unauthorized parking and improving overall management. This approach optimizes parking
space utilization, minimizes congestion, and provides a seamless user experience, contributing
to a smarter and more efficient parking ecosystem.
